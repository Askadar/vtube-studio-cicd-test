# VTube Studio Rainbow

VTube Studio Rainbow is a web-based plugin that allows you to cycle the colors of any ArtMesh(es).

To use the pre-hosted version, simply go to https://askadar.github.io/vtubestudio-rainbow/ while having VTube Studio open.

## For Developers and Enthusiasts

This web app functions by connecting to the VTube Studio plugin server via WebSocket and sending appropriate commands.

It's a modern JavaScript app (technically TypeScript), and you can install its dependencies using `yarn` (or your preferred package manager). You can run it in development mode with `yarn dev` or build it as a static HTML file with `yarn build`.

To launch the app, make sure you have VTube Studio running with the plugin system enabled.
